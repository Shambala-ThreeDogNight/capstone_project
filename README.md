## Motivation
I love displaying data in a way that makes it easy to understand, facilitates discussion, and allows people to make more informed decisions. I also enjoy learning about the factors that make a business successful. So, I used Power BI to create an interactive report that displays sales Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which help a company gauge how well they are meeting their business goals. Studying the KPIs and learning where a business’s strengths and weaknesses are located could help deepen understanding of the business areas to focus on to improve overall performance. 

## Questions
This Power BI report is focused on empowering sales managers to track their team’s quarterly performance. Sales manager goals often involve meeting or exceeding KPIs, understanding current insights about their team, and obtaining actionable information. Here are some of the questions that could help drive their performance: 
1.	Is my sales team performing above average compared to the rest of the sales teams?
2.	How is my team (as a whole and individual team members) doing based on our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)?
3.	Are there team members who need extra support in certain areas? 
4.	Where should we focus our efforts to improve performance?

## Acquiring the Data
Thankfully, I found the Maven Analytics website, with datasets that are free and in the public domain. I selected the CRM Sales Opportunities dataset because it met the capstone project dataset criteria, and because I’m interested in marketing and sales for business success.

## Challenges
The most time-consuming challenge was finding a dataset that met the capstone project criteria. Once I found a good dataset, I used Excel to clean the data. Then I imported the tables into Power BI for further analysis. 

## Technologies Used
•	Excel - for cleaning the dataset

•	Power BI - for calculations, as well as creating data relationships and visuals

•	Dax - for added functionality in Power BI

•	PowerPoint - for an introduction to the project

•	Zoom - for recording the presentation

•	GitHub - for version control and sharing with the public
